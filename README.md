🚀 Current Research & Focus

My primary research addresses privacy challenges in the drone economy using cryptographic primitives. I am building systems that bridge the physical world (IoT) and digital trust (Blockchain).

🚁 Project: ZKP-based Drone Surveillance Privacy

"Proving a drone was not above a person at a specific time/location without revealing its actual flight path."

Core Tech: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs), Smart Contracts, IoT Telemetry.

Tools: LiteZKP, Circom, snarkjs.

Hardware: Integration with ESP32 (autopilot telemetry) and NVIDIA Jetson (edge computing).

Goal: Balancing public safety with individual privacy rights in the era of autonomous drones.

🛠 Tech Stack

I leverage a diverse set of tools to build end-to-end secure systems, from low-level embedded code to modern web interfaces.
